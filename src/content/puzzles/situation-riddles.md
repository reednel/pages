## The Dust

If he had seen the dust, he would have lived.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    *He* is a short person, the shortest person around actually, and he’s in a freak show for that reason. He’s also blind. There’s this other short person who’s not so good at being short, so out of jealousy he slowly grinds down the blind one’s cane, so as to make the blind man feel as though he’s growing. This succeeds, and the blind man is so bummed about losing the one thing that makes him cool that he ends it all. But of course if he had seen the sawdust he would have recognized the deception and lived.

In the meantime, a regent was appointed to the island nation, and he brought peace and prosperity.
