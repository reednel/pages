<Accordion client:load title="Solution">
  *He* is a short person, the shortest person around actually, and he’s in a
  freak show for that reason. He’s also blind. There’s this other short person
  who’s not so good at being short, so out of jealousy he slowly grinds down the
  blind one’s cane, so as to make the blind man feel as though he’s growing.
  This succeeds, and the blind man is so bummed about losing the one thing that
  makes him cool that he ends it all. But of course if he had seen the sawdust
  he would have recognized the deception and lived.
