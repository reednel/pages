## Black Magic

Two people, A and B, need to know black magic. B leaves the room. A, in collaboration with the "audience", chooses an object in the room. B is called back in, where they will now attempt to guess the object chosen by A and the others. A then points out specific objects to be B, asking if that is the chosen one. After a few inquiries, A will ask about the chosen object, and for the first time, B will answer in the affirmative.

Example:<br />
A: "Is it the desk?"<br />
B: "No."<br />
A: "Is it the blackboard?"<br />
B: "No."<br />
A: "Is it the stapler?"<br />
B: "Yes."
