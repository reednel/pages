I would like to make a few notes about my [collection of drinks](/drink).

## Mixing

Many of the recipes I wrote instruct the reader to combine ingredients in a mixing glass before straining it into the serving glass. This is arguably the "professional" thing to do. Sometimes this is appropriate, such as when there are particles to strain off, or you're preparing multiple drinks at once. But if it makes more sense to just build the drink in your serving glass, save yourself the time and dishes.

## Fresh Juice

Any time I refer to a fruit juice in a recipe, it's implied to be in a freshly squeezed form, unless that's particularly unreasonable. Lemon and lime juices, for example, you ought to squeeze fresh, but cranberry juice, probably not. Then again, mix with whatever you want. I'm not your mom.
