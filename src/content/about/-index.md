I am a software engineer at Infinite Campus, and a graduate of UW-Madison with a BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Philosophy. Previously, I worked in the [Sol√≠s-Lemus Lab](https://solislemuslab.github.io/) at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, developing [MiNAA: Microbial Network Alignment Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05448).

My interests include almost anything related to discrete math, but especially graph theory and cryptography. Outside of academia, I enjoy camping, tea, and mathematical/logic riddles.

My modest blog was inspired by Rishi Banerjee's [Rising Entropy](https://risingentropy.com/).
